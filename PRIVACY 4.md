Privacy Policy for Meta-analysis & Systematic REVIEW API
Last Updated: [Date]

We at [Your Organization Name] respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information through the Meta-analysis & Systematic REVIEW API, which offers tools for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including risk of bias assessments, publication bias evaluations, collaborative editing, and umbrella reviews.

1. Information We Collect
API Key: We require an API key to authenticate requests and ensure that the API is used securely and responsibly. This key identifies the user and ensures they have the necessary permissions to access the APIâ€™s services.

Data Input: The data submitted to our API, such as study texts, reviews, and research data, is processed to assess risks of bias, evaluate publication bias, and facilitate collaboration. This data may include:

Study data (effect sizes, sample sizes, p-values, etc.)

Review content (including authorship and analysis plans)

Collaborative review data (changes made by users, conflict resolutions)

2. Use of Data
Processing of Study and Review Data: All data provided to the API is used exclusively to perform the requested tasks, such as conducting risk of bias assessments or generating publication bias evaluations. We process this data on behalf of the user.

Collaboration Features: Data related to collaborative review editing is synchronized and stored for the purposes of collaboration, conflict resolution, and version tracking. Users will have access to the most current version of collaborative projects.

Umbrella Reviews: We aggregate multiple systematic reviews for umbrella reviews. The data submitted for umbrella reviews is processed to synthesize findings and assess the quality of included reviews.

3. Data Storage
All data inputted into the API is processed on our servers or through a third-party provider (e.g., Groq). We do not store any data beyond the period required to fulfill your requests, unless specified by your review project.

Proxy Server: The API is served through a proxy server, which forwards requests to Groq for processing. We ensure that any sensitive information is transmitted securely through HTTPS.

4. Security of Your Data
We use industry-standard encryption and secure transmission protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect your data during transit. We also implement strict access controls to safeguard against unauthorized access.

API Key Security: Your API key serves as a form of authentication and should be kept confidential. If you believe your API key has been compromised, please contact support immediately.

5. Data Retention and Deletion
We will retain your data only for the duration necessary to fulfill the specific requests you make. Upon completion of the tasks, any stored data related to those requests will be deleted in accordance with our data retention policy.

You may request the deletion of your data at any time by contacting our support team.

6. Data Sharing
We do not share or sell your data to third parties. However, we may share your data with service providers who help us operate the API and provide its services, such as Groq for processing requests. These service providers are contractually obligated to keep your data confidential and secure.

We may disclose your data if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or if necessary to protect our rights, property, or the safety of others.

7. User Rights
Access and Control: You have the right to request access to, correction, or deletion of the data you submit to the API. You may also request a copy of the data you have submitted in a portable format.

Withdrawal of Consent: You may withdraw your consent for us to process your data at any time by disabling your API key or contacting support.

Opt-Out: If you no longer wish to use the API or if you do not agree with our data practices, you can opt out by ceasing use of the API and notifying our support team.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated policy on our website and indicate the date of the latest revision. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your data.
